[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.jsx"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "application/javascript"
```

Actually wait — the real issue is different. The error says it's trying to load `/src/main.jsx` directly, which means the build didn't actually compile the React code. Let me check something.

Can you go to your Netlify deploy log and look for the **build output**? Specifically, do you see lines like:
```
vite build
dist/index.html
dist/assets/index-xxxxx.js
